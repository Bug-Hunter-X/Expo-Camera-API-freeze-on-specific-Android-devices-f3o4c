# Expo Camera Freeze on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera API freezes or fails to initialize on certain Android devices. The issue is intermittent and lacks clear error messages, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an affected Android device.  The specific device where this occurs will vary.
4. Observe the camera preview.  It may freeze or fail to load.

## Solution

A temporary workaround is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  This involves additional permission handling and camera release mechanisms to address the unexpected behavior. However, a definitive fix requires further investigation into the root cause.

## Further Investigation

The root cause of this issue remains unclear.  Potential areas for investigation include:
* Deeper inspection of the Android camera system's lifecycle management.
* Handling of low-memory situations on the device.
* Compatibility with various Android versions and camera hardware.
